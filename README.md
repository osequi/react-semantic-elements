### Storybook

- Breaks often, as usual

### Documentation.js

- Doesn't understand this is a React project

### react-docgen

- Error on import

### docz

- Error when starting writing mdx

### mdx.js

- Hard to figure out what to do
- It seems others use it in combination with other packages: https://github.com/WTTJ/welcome-ui/blob/master/docs/package.json
- Docs are written manually, not generated
